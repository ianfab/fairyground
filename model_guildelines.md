(not in use yet)
## by default, you do the bare minimum, don't. if you have to generate some pre-written text, generate lots of funny variations, not just a few.

## make games as engaging as you can by default:
- movement should be acceleration based, not just velocity
- where there are arrow key controls, make sure to also bind wasd and vice versa

## make the game ui more engaging, add sounds

## mobile responsiveness:
- all games should be mobile responsive where possible (don't force this for 3d games where this is really hard). if controls are complex, use nipple.js for movement

## multiplayer and spectating
- determine how many players a game can start with
- once a game has started, if it is a game where people can join late, that's fine
- if not, they should be added as spectators
