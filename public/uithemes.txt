#Fairyground UI themes settings file
#Syntax: 
#Type 1: <UI theme ID>|<display name>
#Type 2: <UI theme ID>|<display name>|<sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>
#<UI theme name>: The unique ID of this theme. Fairyground will load "./assets/theme-ui-<UI theme ID>.css" to HTML stylesheet.
#<display name>: The name of this theme, displayed in the dropdown.
#<sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>: The duration that each sub-theme stays before being automatically switched to next one.
#DO NOT ADD ANY SPACE FOR <UI theme ID> and <sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>

#Explanation on sub-theme (Experimental feature):
#Fairyground supports automatically changing the CSS files to support some advanced style effects like switching background among several images.
#This is enabled when you use type 2 syntax. In this case, Fairyground will load "./assets/theme-ui-<UI theme ID>[<index>].css" to HTML stylesheet.
#<index> starts from 0, and ends at the length of  <sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]> decreased by 1.
#For example:
#"test001|Test 001|2,5,7"
#The ID of this theme is "test001" and the name displayed in the dropdown is "Test 001".
#This will load "./assets/theme-ui-test001[0].css", "./assets/theme-ui-test001[1].css" and "./assets/theme-ui-test001[2].css".
#Meanwhile, when "Test 001" UI theme is selected in the dropdown, these 3 CSS files will get loaded in a cycle automatically.
#"2,5,7" means "./assets/theme-ui-test001[0].css" stays for 2 seconds, "./assets/theme-ui-test001[1].css" stays for 5 seconds, and "./assets/theme-ui-test001[2].css" stays for 7 seconds.

#Known issues:
#1. Choosing a new UI theme when the background is cross fading causes animation error.
#2. Only the background of the main page supports cross fade animation. PGN/EPD parser & binary engine UI backgrounds have no animation.
