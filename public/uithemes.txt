#Fairyground UI themes settings file
#Syntax: 
#Type 1: <UI theme ID>|<display name>
#Type 2: <UI theme ID>|<display name>|<sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>
#Type 3: <UI theme ID>|<display name>|[sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]]|<canvas worker js name>,<canvas frame rate>
#<UI theme name>: The unique ID of this theme. Fairyground will load "./assets/theme-ui-<UI theme ID>.css" to HTML stylesheet.
#<display name>: The name of this theme, displayed in the dropdown.
#<sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>: The duration that each sub-theme stays before being automatically switched to next one.
#<canvas worker js name>: The name of the canvas worker JavaScript. It is located in ./src/js/<canvas worker js name>.canvas.worker.js.
#<canvas frame rate>: The frame rate that the canvas should be running at. Note that for built-in scripts the move speed of elements will have some difference at different frame rate.
#DO NOT ADD ANY SPACE FOR <UI theme ID>, <sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]>, <canvas worker js name> and <canvas frame rate>

#Explanation on sub-theme (Experimental feature):
#Fairyground supports automatically changing the CSS files to support some advanced style effects like switching background among several images.
#This is enabled when you use type 2 syntax. In this case, Fairyground will load "./assets/theme-ui-<UI theme ID>[<index>].css" to HTML stylesheet.
#<index> starts from 0, and ends at the length of  <sub-theme duration in seconds [,...]> decreased by 1.
#For example:
#"test001|Test 001|2,5,7"
#The ID of this theme is "test001" and the name displayed in the dropdown is "Test 001".
#This will load "./assets/theme-ui-test001[0].css", "./assets/theme-ui-test001[1].css" and "./assets/theme-ui-test001[2].css".
#Meanwhile, when "Test 001" UI theme is selected in the dropdown, these 3 CSS files will get loaded in a cycle automatically.
#"2,5,7" means "./assets/theme-ui-test001[0].css" stays for 2 seconds, "./assets/theme-ui-test001[1].css" stays for 5 seconds, and "./assets/theme-ui-test001[2].css" stays for 7 seconds.

#Explanation on canvas:
#Fairyground supports loading animations on a HTMLCanvasElement using OffscreenCanvas mode, which means the canvas is render by a worker script in a thread other than the main thread which prevents lag in main page while rendering the canvas.
#The main page loads the worker script and controls the canvas rendering by posting message to the worker script.
#The creation, deletion and transferring of canvas are handled by the main page. The worker script only focuses on rendering the canvas.
#You can view the builtin script "particles-bubbles.canvas.worker.js" and "particles-stars.canvas.worker.js" to find out how to write your own script.

#Known issues:
#1. Choosing a new UI theme when the background is cross fading causes animation error.
#2. Only the background of the main page supports cross fade animation. PGN/EPD parser & binary engine UI backgrounds have no animation.
