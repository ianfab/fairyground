#Theme settings file for fairyground (experimental)
#Lines start with "#" are comments.

#Syntax:
#[variant_name]|[piece_theme_name][,...]|[board_theme_name][,...]
#For example:
#1  "chess|merida,cburnett|"
#2  "minichess||miniboard"
#3  "aaa|bbb|ccc"
#Adding these 3 lines in this file will tell the main webpage that:
#"chess" will use "merida" and "cburnett" as the piece theme.
#"minichess" will use "miniboard" as the board theme.
#"aaa" will use "bbb" as the piece theme and "ccc" as the board theme.
#[piece_theme_name] and [board_theme_name] can't be both empty like: "variant||".
#[piece_theme_name] and [board_theme_name] can't be the same.
#[piece_theme_name] and [board_theme_name] can't start with non-letter(A-Z,a-z) characters like "2dletter" or "-mytheme". (This will mess up CSS class names)
#The CSS File of piece theme will be automatically searched at path "./assets/theme-piece-[piece_theme_name].css" (if it's defined)
#The CSS File of board theme will be automatically searched at path "./assets/theme-board-[board_theme_name].css" (if it's defined)
#Where "." is the location of this file.
#If you want to add themes here, make sure that the CSS file(s) is/are placed at the location above and named correctly. (Path to picture files are defined in CSS files.)
#[piece_theme_name] and [board_theme_name] cannot be "default" or "defaultboard". They are reserved names for default values.
#DO NOT ADD ANY SPACES IN ANY LINE!


#Special values:

#<variant_name>:
#1. You can leave it as empty. This will make the piece/board themes specified in this line apply to all other variants that are not given an explicit definition on piece/board theme.
#For example: 
#1  "|merida,cburnett|blueboard,greenboard,brownboard"
#2  "spartan|spartan|"
#3  "xiangqi||xiangqiboard"
#This line makes "merida" and "cburnett" piece theme apply to xiangqi variant, while "blueboard", "greenboard" and "brownboard" board theme apply to spartan variant.
#Since spartan variant has explicitly required that it needs "spartan" piece theme, the first line has no effect to the piece theme of spartan variant.
#So does the board theme of xiangqi.
#2. You can use a single asteroid (*) to act as a wildcard to make the themes apply to all lines after this line.
#For example:
#1  "*|letters|"
#2  "chess|merida|"
#3  "*|theme001|theme001board"
#4  "shogi|portella|"
#In this case, "letters" piece theme (line 1) will be applied to line 2 and line 4, while "theme001" piece theme and "theme001board" board theme (line 3) will be only applied to line 4.
#This is because this wildcard can only match lines behind it.
#So if you want to make theme001 and theme001board applies to all, you need to move it ahead of all variant theme definition lines, like this:
#1  "*|letters|"
#2  "*|theme001|theme001board"
#3  "chess|merida|"
#4  "shogi|portella|"
#Note that the order between wildcard lines does not make any difference, for example:
#1  "*|letters|"
#2  "*|theme001|theme001board"
#and
#1  "*|theme001|theme001board"
#2  "*|letters|"
#have the same effect.

#[piece_theme_name] and [board_theme_name]:
#1. You may use @ at the beginning of the name to indicate that it uses the themes of another variant (reference).
#For example:
#1  "seirawan|seirawan,merida|"
#2  "shouse|@seirawan|"
#This means that "shouse" variant will use the piece theme "seirwan" and "merida", which are defined in "seirwan" variant.(@seirwan)
#However, the reference line must be behind the line to refer to.
#For example:
#1  "shouse|@seirawan|"
#2  "seirawan|seirawan,merida|"
#You will receive a warning in console that "seirwan" variant is not defined.
#This is because you put a reference line (line 1) ahead of the definition line (line 2, line 1 is ahead of line 2).
#"@" works on both piece theme and board theme.
