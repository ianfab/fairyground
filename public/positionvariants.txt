chess|Handicap|Queen And Rooks Down|1nb1kbn1/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|Remember the techniques: use ALL of your pieces.
chess|Handicap|Queen, Knight And Bishop Down|r3kbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Use ALL of your pieces here and recognize threats from your opponent. Make good trades if you can!
chess|Handicap|Queen Down|rnb1kbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Although a queen might be important, the material difference here is much smaller than previous ones.

Your opponent is not allowed to castle in this position, and the hint here is to prevent your opponent's rooks become active as well as exploit your opponent's king safety. This would be the hardest handicap as there is no actual material difference. Stay care!
