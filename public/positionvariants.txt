chess|Mate Endgame|Queen Mate|8/8/8/8/3k4/1Q6/8/K7 w - - 0 1|Mate black king with your queen! If you can win this, then it means that you can simply win with a promoted pawn! However, queen cannot mate by herself. King's support is needed.
chess|Mate Endgame|Rook Mate|8/8/8/8/4k3/8/8/4K2R w K - 0 1|Mate black king with your rook! Remember a rook a control a whole file & rank, which can block the king from passing it.
chess|Mate Endgame|Two Bishops Mate|8/8/8/B7/B2k4/8/8/K7 w - - 0 1|Mate black king with your bishops! Teamwork is important this case. Your bishops must push the king into a corner as only there you can mate him. A way to reach that is to push with your king and bishops stang side by side blocking the escape route. BE CAREFUL ON STALEMATES!
chess|Mate Endgame|Bishop And Knight Mate - The Edge|5k2/5N2/5K2/5B2/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 1|This is a challenging position for you to try. You need to mate black for more than 5 times before you try the next one. Remember that you can only mate the king in the corner that has the same color with the bishop.
chess|Mate Endgame|Bishop And Knight Mate (Advanced)|K1k1B3/8/8/8/8/8/7N/8 w - - 0 1|Before solving this, try to solve the previous one. This is one of the hardest endgames. Remember that you can only mate the king in the corner that has the same color with the bishop. You need to organize all of your pieces and push black king into edge. And then, you can use the experience you got in the previous one.
chess|Mate Endgame|2 Knights VS Pawn|8/4k3/4p3/8/8/1K1N4/8/2N5 w - - 0 1|This is a very very hard mate. It's well known that 2 knights cannot mate a king against best defense, but if there's an extra pawn present, which can prevent stalemate at a key moment, white has a chance to win. Block the pawn with one knight and use your king and the other knight to trap the king in corner. Finally release the blockade on the pawn and bring the other knight over to deliver checkmate while the pawn advances.
chess|Mate Endgame|2 Knights VS Pawn (Advanced)|8/8/8/8/2N4p/7N/2K5/k7 w - - 0 1|This mate is harder than the previous one. The pawn is more advanced and you must coordinate your knights correctly. Remember that taking the pawn will result in immediate draw. You must block the pawn and let it advance at correct time to avoid stalemate and avoid its promotion.

chess|Pawn Endgame|Two Extra Pawns|6k1/pp4pp/8/8/8/8/PPP2PPP/6K1 w - - 0 1|Show your basic pawn endgame skills by winning this against the very toughest of competition. You are able to make a passed pawn on both sides of the board. When you have a passed pawn, the opponent's king will have to block it from queening, and you will have two main plans for winning: go attack the pawns on the other side with your king or defend the passed pawn with your king, and advance the extra pawn on the other side of the board to make a second passed pawn.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Using An Extra Passed Pawn|2k5/5ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/P4PPP/2K5 w - - 0 1|At some point, you must use your extra passed pawn on the queenside as a decoy, allowing your king to hunt pawns.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Creating An Outside Passed Pawn|4k3/5ppp/4p3/1p6/8/PP5P/4KPP1/8 w - - 0 1|Use the outside passed pawn and an active king to grab the kingside pawns while Black is worrying about the queenside pawn.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Using The Active King|8/p7/1p1k2p1/6P1/P1K5/8/1P6/8 w - - 0 1|Force Black's king into a passive position by attacking the queenside.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Using An Outside Passed Pawn|8/8/8/6p1/1kp2p1p/5P1P/PK4P1/8 w - - 0 1|Your pawns cannot always promote on their own, but you can use them as decoys to draw the enemy king into a bad position.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Creating Zugzwang|8/5pp1/Kp5p/1Pk5/8/8/5PPP/8 w - - 0 1|Note that if either king moves, the moving side will lose their b-pawn and with it, the game. Don't be first to run out of pawn moves!
chess|Pawn Endgame|3 VS 3|6k1/5ppp/8/8/8/8/5PPP/6K1 w - - 0 1|Get your king as far advanced as possible. Your pawns should act as a unit, defending each other.
chess|Pawn Endgame|Opposing Majorities|8/ppp1kppp/8/8/3KP3/P7/1P3PPP/8 w - - 0 1|White has an active king, but you will have to make good use of your kingside majority here to maintain the advantage.

chess|Knight Endgame|Symmetrical Pawns|3n2k1/p4pp1/1p5p/4pN2/8/1P4P1/P3PPKP/8 w - - 0 1|You must play soundly, activating your king and your knight, and be especially careful about knight forks.
chess|Knight Endgame|An Extra Pawn|8/6k1/p3n1pp/1p6/1P6/5P2/P5PP/4N1K1 w - - 0 1|If a pawn endgame is winning, adding knights should not change the evaluation - but it can be much harder to win.
chess|Knight Endgame|Few Pawns Remain|8/8/5pk1/6p1/8/2n5/5KP1/4N3 w - - 0 1|When only a few pawns remain, you can sacrifice the knight for the last pawns and draw.
chess|Knight Endgame|Space Advantage|4n3/p3kpp1/1p5p/1P2P2P/4KPP1/5N2/8/8 w - - 0 1|Use your space advantage patiently, pressuring Black on both sides of the board. Black will be unable to defend both wings.
chess|Knight Endgame|Queenside Majorities|6k1/pp3pp1/4pn1p/8/2P5/5N1P/PP3PP1/6K1 w - - 0 1|Make the most of your majority on the queenside. A passed pawn can be dangerous on the far side of the board.
chess|Knight Endgame|Kingside Majorities|6k1/pp3pp1/5n1p/2p5/8/4PN1P/PP3PP1/6K1 w - - 0 1|You can hold the draw. Address your king first. You may want to mobilize your kingside pawns at some point.

chess|Same-color Bishop Endgame|An Extra Pawn|8/p4k1p/1p2bpp1/8/8/2P5/PP3PPP/1B4K1 w - - 0 1|Keep your pawns on the opposite color of the bishops and lock Black's pawns on the bishops' color. Avoid too many pawn trades.

chess|Same-color Bishop Endgame|Queenside Majority|3b2k1/pp3pp1/4p2p/8/2P5/7P/PP3PPB/6K1 w - - 0 1|The queenside majority is a nice advantage. Create a passed pawn and you will be doing well. Don't forget to activate your king!
chess|Same-color Bishop Endgame|Kingside Majority|6k1/pp3ppb/7p/2p5/8/4P2P/PP3PP1/3B2K1 w - - 0 1|Get your pieces to the queenside before things become dangerous and, at the right time, use your own kingside pawn majority.
chess|Same-color Bishop Endgame|Centralization|1B6/4b3/pp3k1p/6p1/3PK1p1/1P6/P6P/8 w - - 0 1|You are better here, thanks to your central control and central passed pawn. Make those advantages count.
chess|Same-color Bishop Endgame|Bishop Pair|4r1k1/2n1bppp/p3p3/1p6/8/1P2B1P1/P3PPBP/R5K1 w - - 0 1|Make confident, patient progress knowing that as the game progresses, your bishops should only get stronger.

chess|Queen Endgame|Centralization|3q2k1/5pp1/p6p/Pp6/1P5P/5PP1/6K1/1Q6 w - - 0 1|The key to queen endgames is often centralization. Improve your queen and have no fear.

chess|Handicap|All Down|4k3/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|This would be simple, right? Just overwhelm the engine as fast as possible.
chess|Handicap|Only Knight And Bishop|4kbn1/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|Practice winning the game with a large material advantage. The best hint here is to use ALL of your pieces.
chess|Handicap|Queen And Rooks Down|1nb1kbn1/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|Remember the techniques: use ALL of your pieces.
chess|Handicap|Queen, Knight And Bishop Down|r3kbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Use ALL of your pieces here and recognize threats from your opponent. Make good trades if you can!
chess|Handicap|Queen Down|rnb1kbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Although a queen might be important, the material difference here is much smaller than previous ones. The computer is unlikely to make blunders, so you need to make accurate moves here. Again, use ALL of your piece and find helpful trades. Pay attention to forks, screws, discovered attacks, etc.
chess|Handicap|Rooks Down|1nbqkbn1/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|Rooks are important for back rank safety and support to other pieces during midgame. Try to exploit your opponent's safety in backrank and press extra pressure to your opponent's pieces to gain advantage.
chess|Handicap|Knights Down|r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Knights are important at opening and middlegame as they can jump over pieces. (However, in larger boards like 10x10 or larger, knights would be less valueable as they are too slow). Exploit your opponent's weakness on controling the center and use your knights to attack your opponent's major pieces.
chess|Handicap|Bishops Down|rn1qk1nr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|Bishops can move diagonally which makes them easy to go through pawn chains. This enables them to control the center in the early stage. Use your bishops to attack your opponents weaknesses and major pieces.
chess|Handicap|No Castling|rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 0 1|Castling can make your rooks active and moves king to corner in one move. Your opponent is not allowed to castle in this position, and the hint here is to prevent your opponent's rooks become active as well as exploit your opponent's king safety. This would be the hardest handicap as there is no actual material difference. Stay care!

chess|Minigame|No Center Chess|rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/3**3/3**3/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1|It's well-known that controlling the center of the board is important, but what if the center is blocked? Figure out what would happen in this position.
